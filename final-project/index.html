    <h3> Published 5:00 AM EST Mar. 2, 2023 | Updated 11:58 AM EST Mar. 2, 2023 </h3>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>Your 11-year-old son walks down the street to play with a friend after school.   When dinnertime approaches and he hasn’t returned, you call his friend’s mom and ask her to send your son home. Distress is palpable in her voice as she tells you he isn’t there. He left 45 minutes ago.</p>

            <p>You panic, running down the block to make sure, but there’s been no mistake. Your son is gone.   Your fingers shake as you dial 911.   What happens next depends on where you live.   Law enforcement agencies across the country operate under a patchwork of rules that govern how intensely they search for missing children. The degree of effort often depends entirely on a child’s age or an officer’s discretion. As a result, kids the same age can disappear under similar circumstances and receive vastly different responses from police.</p>
            
            <p>In dozens of cities and towns, the child’s age alone can move them to the bottom of the priority list, according to a USA TODAY analysis of standard operating procedures for more than 50 law enforcement organizations. Once that happens, it takes a preliminary investigation or an officer’s initiative to move them back up. For the New Hampshire State Police, the general age cutoff for more extensive police investigation into a missing child is 17. For Louisville police, it’s 10. That means a missing 11-year-old in Louisville would typically draw less attention from law enforcement than a 16-year-old in New Hampshire.</p>

            <p>If children are over the age limits, their cases require special circumstances – such as a health condition that requires medication or a drug addiction – to warrant extra effort. That gives the first patrol officer who speaks to a missing child’s family enormous power.</p>

            <p>If children are over the age limits, their cases require special circumstances – such as a health condition that requires medication or a drug addiction – to warrant extra effort. That gives the first patrol officer who speaks to a missing child’s family enormous power.</p>  

            <p>That officer’s opinions about the child’s maturity, mental health or relationship with their parents can dramatically affect the quality of the investigation – or whether there is an investigation at all. That discretion can result in discrimination.</p>  

            <p>“The first initial encounter with law enforcement really sets the ball rolling for how these individual cases are being handled and treated and even responded to in the media,” said Gaétane Borders, president of Peas in Their Pods, a nonprofit that advocates for missing children of color and their families.  “At the heart of it, that can be started by the inherent bias and racism that exists.”  </p>

        <p>More than 60% of the agencies examined by USA TODAY set a maximum age at which missing children are considered “critical” or “at risk” and therefore worthy of thorough investigation regardless of the circumstances. In Louisville, for example, the cutoff is 10. For the New Hampshire State Police, it’s 17. That means a missing 11-year-old in Louisville would typically draw less attention from law enforcement than a 16-year-old in New Hampshire.  </p>

            <p>Often, children who fall outside the age limits or special circumstances listed in department rules receive virtually no attention from law enforcement, said Melissa Snow, an executive director at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.  </p>
            <p>“In many scenarios … the only person that’s aware that the kid is missing is the person that made the report and the person that took the report,” she said. “In many situations, there is absolutely nobody looking for that kid other than people that intend to do harm to them.” </p>
            <p>USA TODAY’s review of police standard operating procedures is part of an ongoing examination of disparities in cases of missing children. Previous stories detailed why a lack of diversity in DNA databases hinders investigations into missing Black children and how effective Amber Alerts are in finding missing kids.    </p>
            <p>In 2021, 335,000 reports of missing children were sent to the FBI, down from 365,000 the year before. About 90% of them were found. Of those not found within six months, a disproportionate number were Black. </p>
            <p>How rapidly and thoroughly law enforcement responds to a missing child can make a crucial difference in the outcome. Thousands of missing kids a year are never reported to the FBI because they are quickly found.  </p>
            <p>The longer children are missing, the more likely they are to be harmed. A 2006 study by the Washington state attorney general’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice reviewed the cases of nearly 800 missing children later found murdered. In 76% of cases, the child was killed within three hours. In 88.5% of cases, they were killed within a day.    </p>
            <p>Because of limited budgets and personnel, law enforcement is forced to prioritize, said Lt. Cyrus Zafrani, who oversees crimes against children for the Dallas Police Department. But he wishes they didn’t have to. All missing children are vulnerable because they can’t take care of themselves long-term, he said. </p>
            <p>“They’re getting assistance from somewhere,” Zafrani said. “In a lot of cases, it’s who they run into in the streets, and predators are out there.”    </p>
